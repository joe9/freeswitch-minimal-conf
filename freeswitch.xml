  <!--#comment
      All comments starting with #command will be preprocessed and never sent to the xml parser
      Valid instructions:
      #include ==> Include another file to this exact point
                   (partial xml should be encased in <include></include> tags)
      #set     ==> Set a global variable (can be expanded during preprocessing with $$ variables)
                   (note the double $$ which denotes preprocessor variables)
      #comment ==> A general comment such as this

      The preprocessor will compile the full xml document to ${prefix}/log/freeswitch.xml.fsxml
      Don't modify it while freeswitch is running cos it is mem mapped in most cases =D

      The same can be achieved with the <X-PRE-PROCESS> tag where the attrs 'cmd' and 'data' are
      parsed in the same way.
  -->
  <!--#comment
      vars.xml contains all the #set directives for the preprocessor.
